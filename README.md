# Noda-Integration-API
Starter Kit for building Noda add-on apps

You can use this starter kit to create a mini-app that runs inside the [Noda virtual reality app](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3916601848368970) 

Your app can query external data sources and render the content into the Noda VR experience running on the Meta Quest headset. Your app will benefit from the rendering and input handling that Noda provides and gives you a compact API that is used to show your data and UI to the user.

This is an easy and powerful way to create an XR data visualization without the complexities of creating a game-engine or native code based app and reach a large existing audience of users.

The simple.html shows a set of forms for creating, updating and deleting nodes and links in the VR scene. It also shows event handling for reacting to changes the user makes in the VR scene.
